            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Harly Resins was founded with a passion for creating beautiful, handmade resin products that bring joy and functionality to everyday life. 
                Our journey began with a simple idea: to combine art and creativity into unique pieces that reflect individual styles.

        <div class="how-we-started">
            <h1>How we started</h1>

            <p>Harly Resins began in the most unexpected way — inside our college dorm room. We didn't have a studio, proper tools, or even much experience. What we did have was curiosity, creativity, and one small resin kit we bought simply because we wanted to “try something new.”
                At first, it was just a fun activity between classes. We mixed colors on the floor, experimented with dried flowers, poured resin into random molds, and waited impatiently for each piece to cure. We didn't expect much — but the moment we created our first successful piece, something changed. It felt exciting, almost magical, to watch clear liquid turn into something glossy, colorful, and beautiful.
                We kept creating, learning, and failing forward. Our friends saw our early pieces and started asking if they could buy some. People wanted keychains, bookmarks, and tiny gifts. That was the first moment we realized:
                this wasn't just a hobby anymore — it was something people connected with.
                What began as three friends experimenting with resin in a cramped room slowly turned into a small handmade brand with a big dream: to create beautiful, meaningful pieces that bring joy to everyday life

        <div class="why-we-started">

            <h1>Why we started</h1>

                <p>We started this brand because we saw how something small — a keychain, a bookmark, a tray — could become more than just an object. As we kept creating in that tiny dorm room, we realized that resin wasn't just a fun craft for us; it was a way to turn everyday items into small pieces of art.
                    We wanted people to feel something when they held our pieces — a touch of beauty, a moment of joy, something personal they could carry or gift. Every swirl of color, every dried flower, every gold flake felt like a tiny expression of creativity. And when people started connecting with our work, we knew we were making more than products — we were creating meaningful little details that brighten everyday life.
                    That feeling is what inspired Harly Resins: the idea that ordinary things can be transformed into something beautiful, personal, and made with heart.

            <h1>How its going</h1>
                <p>Today, we're a growing small business run by three students juggling classes,
                     deadlines, and resin pours at 2AM — and honestly? We love it. Each order, 
                     each custom request, each message from someone who loved their piece pushes us to 
                     create even better art. We've expanded from simple keychains to trays, bookmarks, phone 
                     stands, beads, and more, all handmade with the same excitement we had on day one.
                    We're learning, improving, experimenting with new molds and colors, and slowly turning 
                    our little dream into something real. And the best part? We're just getting started.
